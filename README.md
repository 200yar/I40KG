# StandardsVocabulary
Standard Ontology is used for describing standards and their relations. Characteristics of I4.0 standards
are described using STO, and these descriptions are exploited for classifying standards from different perspectives according
to reference architectures. Moreover, semantics encoded in STO allows for the discovery of relations between I4.0 standards, and
for mappings across reference architectures proposed by different industrial communities

# LOV
Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV): a gateway to reusable semantic vocabularies on the Web <br/>
We have reused the following linked open vocabularies in Standard Ontology
foaf,vcard,cc,dbpedia,geonomes,purl,schema.org,purl & dcterms


# Reference Architectures IOT 4.0 
Standard Ontology is planned to add following reference architectures <br/>
In Germany Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) published “Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0)” <br/>
In United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published “Standards Landscape for Smart Manufacturing Systems”<br/>
In China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and the Standardization Administration of China (SAC) published the “National Smart Manufacturing Standards Architecture Construction Guidance” <br/>


# Organisations
Standard Ontology used the following organizations 
OAGi, ETSI, W3C, NIST, IBM, MESA, VDMA, IEC, SE, eClassAssoc, ISA, MTConnect_Institute, ASAM, ISO, BBF, ANSI, OMG, ODVA, OASIS, OPC_Foundation.

# License
The standard ontology is proposed by Fraunhofer IAIS (Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems), Sankt Augustin, Germany with the help of EIS (Enterprise Information Systems) department of the University of Bonn.
