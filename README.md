# StandardsVocabulary
Standard Ontology is used for describing standards and their relations. Characteristics of I4.0 standards
are described using STO, and these descriptions are exploited for classifying standards from different perspectives according
to reference architectures. Moreover, semantics encoded in STO allows for the discovery of relations between I4.0 standards, and
for mappings across reference architectures proposed by different industrial communities

# LOV
Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV): a gateway to reusable semantic vocabularies on the Web.We have reused the following linked open vocabularies in Standard Ontology<br/>
foaf,vcard,cc,dbpedia,geonomes,purl,schema.org,purl & dcterms


# Reference Architectures IOT 4.0 
Standard Ontology is planned to add following reference architectures <br/>
<a href="https://www.zvei.org/en/subjects/industry-4-0/the-reference-architectural-model-rami-40-and-the-industrie-40-component/">Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0)</a>
<a href="https://www.nist.gov/">Standards Landscape for Smart Manufacturing Systems</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Industry_and_Information_Technology">National Smart Manufacturing Standards Architecture Construction Guidance</a>


# Organisations
